<p>So, this is 'Third World Programmer'.</p>
<p>You might ask what's up with the weird, if not edgy title.</p>
<p>I've always believed that with living in the third world, you're having your own particular set of challenges.</p>
<p>For a lot of people there's a sense of bleakness. More controlled by society. More by norms. Less of the desirable things you'd look to in the West.</p>
And when those things are available, they're likely unreasonably expensive and also hurt your conscience for indulging in those things. Even the things made natively in where you live,
cost so much that it seems unreasonable to spend the money for said purpose instead of spending it at say, a Kiosk and getting more for your money. And helping the poor person or family running it.
<p>Now for programming, you're in a strange situation. Hardware costs a ton, computers too generally. And you're still needing them to program. And, can you stay diligent? If you waste time, you're essentially misusing opportunity that</p>
others don't have.
<p>Would you be able to live life on your terms someday? The web is large and there seems to be stories of people making a lot of money from programming. When you look into the means and when you look into freelancing sites in particular, you might</p>
naturally feel intimidated. You'd be needing to learn a plethora of technologies to earn a subpar amount, and a lot of people on these websites have portfolios that might make you feel even worse with it seeming impossible to reach that point. A lot of moving parts,
A lot of niceties. While you're too afraid to code up something. Afraid you'd fail, subconsciously. Afraid, even though it's essentially typing up things. Even by yourself, when there's no consequence. You'd often be crippled by fear.
<p>These and a few more that I would add to this list are problems I believe a lot of people either don't face or don't acknowledge. They're always there, but... these issues I've mentioned, what can you do about the larger phenomena that exists?</p>
<p>Is there anything to be done? Is there a real problem out there? Is it just in your mind? Are you sure you aren't just depressed? Well, as for the last part, in my case I'm not sure. If it's a clinical condition I can't self diagnose. But I've been crippled and have been dealing with issues that</p>
I kept aside for a long time instead of dealing with them. Instead of moving. Instead of executing. Instead of standing on my own ground.
<p>And this is me executing. Despite the vagueness, despite the subpar quality of this blog, I will execute. I will burn my way through to where I want to reach.</p>
<p>And if you see a solution for your problems as well in seeing me do this, feel free to implement what you wish. Some things might not work verbatim while some might, nothing might help at all in the case of some people. We're all different. But, I want to help. And not cripple you further in the things I say here.</p>
I'll bring up solutions. Lots of them that you might feel like options you could use, instead of crippling you with requirements. Or even options.
<p>This will be a constant work in progress but I'm executing and pushing it forward. Keep watching me.</p>
