%h2.article-title So, technically my first blog post that I'll put here

    There's not really a whole lot to say. My blog is imperfect. I've decided to execute. And not be held down on the sidelines.
    In fact, I realized I would much rather drown in medicority... from desperate attempts where I would be doing what I want and believe in and growing through that process.
    As a result you see this blog here. Shabby as it is, as old as the idea was, and as ill defind as the idea had been for several years, it's finally executed on.
    And will be iterated on.

    I believe it was the person who founded LinkedIn who said that if you aren't embarrassed seeing your first product, then you've already launched too late.
    I don't really think I'll be making (much) money off of this. Directly or indirectly. Besides I don't want to corrupt what I want to gain from this.
    At the same time I don't want to ruin the target audience's desire for making money off of skills they could learn by themselves. Without getting bogged down by details and vastness.
    Or needing beefy systems.

    You just need to keep at it. That's the better way to live by. And you can start right now. Don't be held by the sidelines. I'm doing this to show this to myself as well.
    So let's start together shall we.
